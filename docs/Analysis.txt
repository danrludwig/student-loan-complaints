-- Analysis --

After getting topics from the LDA model I looked at the tokenized versions of the top 5 complaints for each topic 
(the top 5 complaints were the complaints with the highest topic percentage contribution for that specific topic) 
and entitled those different topics:

Topic # - Topic title

    0 - Agreement disputes
    1 - Ameritech issues
    2 - University attended closed early
    3 - Debt forgiveness
    4 - Credit score issues
    5 - Need new payment plan (can't afford current one)
    6 - Payment issues
    7 - Customer service issues

From our exploritory analysis we listed the different categories of issues in the dataset were:

    Can't repay my loan
    Credit monitoring or identity theft protection services
    Dealing with my lender or servicer
    Dealing with your lender or servicer
    Getting a loan
    Improper use of your report
    Incorrect infomration on your report
    Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem
    Problem with fraud alerts or security  freezes
    Struggling to repay your loan
    Unable to get your credit report or credit score

There were 11 original issues listed in the dataset, which we went with 8 topics for the lda model because 
that number yielded the highest coherence score. We knew not all of these topics were going to match exactly,
but we figured most of them would be pretty similar, with just a few differences. The goal of this was to 
see if there was any common issues the original dataset wasn't seeing (or they just didn't have a category 
for).

The most frequent topics from the LDA model are 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7 (with each of them having over 2000 instances).
Comparing the more common topics to the list of issues from the dataset, there are two topics that aren't found
as an issue category in the dataset (3 - Dept forgiveness, and 5 - Need new payment plan (can't afford current 
one)).

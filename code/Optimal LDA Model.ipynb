They told me to go through the application anyway and that once the account was opened that I could add autopay and receive the discount that way. \r\n\r\nSince I have had the account opened I have called their call center at least 4 times trying to receive my autopay discount and each of the first 3 times I was told it was going to be applied and still have not seen it. Additionally, this last time I called about 3 weeks ago and I asked to speak to a manager and was told it would take 10 days for them to get back to me. I still have yet to hear back from them 15+ business days later. \r\n\r\nI was told that I would be receiving the autopay discount and am not receiving it so I opened this account up with this company lying to me about the rate of the loan I was going to receive. Its not as if I dont have autopay initiates, I have had 2 autopays go through so far. \r\n\r\nI have an additional issue where they told me that my rate was going to be based off the 1 month libor rate as published in the wsj on the XXXX of that month.
